# This is an example markdown file to demonstrate Shift Enter

Here is some regular text.

And now we have some code:

```python
print('Hello world')
a = 40
b = 2
c = a + b 
print('The answer is', c)
```

Select text to run only that text with `shift enter`, or if inside a block `shift enter` will run the code block.
